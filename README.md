I made my cat sammy in minecraft <3

Yes, he is an all black cat and this model already exists, but i gave him retractble claws because he likes to claw things. I gave him extra puffy cheeks because he is a big boy.

Sammy can be crafted with some expensive items, some items that are hard to obtain and some ritualistic items. I made him unkillable, because in a just world, our sweet innocent pets will live forever. Bec ause he is undying, you will need to sacrifice a totem of undying to create this immortal kitty. Upon crafting, you get a Sammy egg, which you can use to summon Sammy from the ether! Once summoned, he is technically "wild" so you will need to tame him with some fish. The Sammy egg is consumed.

For the most part, Sammy behaves as a normal Minecraft cat should with a few improvements:
    - Fetches dropped items and will hold them in his mouth. He will relinquish the item for a price, something very precious to him. FIsh and string! :D
    - Catches and kills fish! He will hold him in his mouth for a while and eventually eat them.
    - Randomly loafs around.
    - Gets upset when wet!
    - Custom idle animation!
